🔒 Phishing Link Detector

A machine learning–based phishing URL detector that identifies malicious links by analyzing their structure and features. The project helps users stay safe online by classifying links as legitimate or phishing with high accuracy.

🚀 Features

Extracts URL-based features such as length, special characters, and domain patterns.

Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM) for classification.

Detects suspicious patterns in real-time to warn users.

Provides a simple interface for inputting and testing URLs.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model: Supervised machine learning (trained on phishing + legitimate URL datasets)

📊 Workflow
