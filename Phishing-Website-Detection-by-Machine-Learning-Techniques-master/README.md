THIS IS A CODING FILE WHICH IS INITIATED WITH GOOGLE COLAB
THESE CODES ARE AN AI MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNING-----> USING THIS WE ARE TRAINING THE MODEL FOR THE SET OF GIVEN DATA AND CONDITION





IN THIS OCDE I HAVE USED VARIOUS METHODS IN MACHINE LEARNING 
STEP 1 : TO DETERMINE THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CODE.
STEP 2 : TO LOAD THE DATA.
STEP 3 : TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA.
STEP 4 : TO VISUALIZE THE DATA.
STEP 5 : TO PROCESS THE DATA AND EDA.
STEP 6 : TO CATOGORIZE THE DATA.
STEP 7 : TO USE VARIOUS METHODS IN MACHINE LEARNING MODELS & TRAINING THEM.
STEP 8 : TO COMPARE THE MODEL.
STEP 9 : TO SAVE THE TRAINED MODEL.


THE UPCOMING CODE WILL BE TO USE THIS PARTICULAR TRAINED AI TO IMPLEMENT INTO THE SOFTWARE SUCH AS EXTENSION OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS OF METHODS.......
